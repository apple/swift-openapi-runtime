This library provides common abstractions and helper functions used by the client and server code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator][0].

## Overview

It contains:
- Common types used in the code generated by the `swift-openapi-generator` package plugin.
- Protocol definitions for pluggable layers, including [`ClientTransport`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/clienttransport), [`ServerTransport`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/servertransport), [`ClientMiddleware`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/clientmiddleware), and [`ServerMiddleware`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/servermiddleware).

Many of the HTTP currency types used are defined in the [Swift HTTP Types](https://github.com/apple/swift-http-types) library.

> Tip: Check out the [example projects](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator/documentation/swift-openapi-generator/checking-out-an-example-project) focused on middlewares.

## Usage

Add the package dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime", from: "1.0.0"),
```

Next, in your target, add `OpenAPIRuntime` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIRuntime", package: "swift-openapi-runtime"),
]),
```

The next step depends on your use case.

### Using Swift OpenAPI Generator for code generation

The generated code depends on types from this library. Check out the adoption guides in the [Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation][1] to see how the packages fit together.

### Implementing transports and middlewares

Swift OpenAPI Generator generates client and server code that is designed to be used with pluggable transports and middlewares.

Implement a new transport or middleware by providing a type that adopts one of the protocols from the runtime library:

* [`ClientTransport`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/clienttransport)
* [`ClientMiddleware`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/clientmiddleware)
* [`ServerTransport`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/servertransport)
* [`ServerMiddleware`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/documentation/openapiruntime/servermiddleware)

You can also publish your transport or middleware as a Swift package to allow others to use it with their generated code.
