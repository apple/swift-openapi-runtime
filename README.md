# Swift OpenAPI Generator Runtime

This library provides common abstractions and helper functions used by all client and server code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator][0].

## Supported use cases

1. Use the types from this library to instantiate your generated client and server code. To learn more, review the adoption guides in the [Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation][1].
2. Implement a custom transport or middleware to extend your generated client and server. For client code, check out `ClientTransport` and `ClientMiddleware`. For server code, check out `ServerTransport` and `ServerMiddleware`.

## Getting started

To depend on the runtime API package, add the dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime", from: "0.1.0"),
```

and in your target, add `OpenAPIRuntime` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIRuntime", package: "swift-openapi-runtime"),
],
```

Now you can use the library as described in [Supported use cases](#Supported-use-cases).
