# Swift OpenAPI Generator Runtime

This library provides common abstractions and helper functions used by the client and server code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator][0].

## Overview

It contains:
- Common types used in the code generated by the `swift-openapi-generator` package plugin.
- Protocol definitions for pluggable layers, including `ClientTransport`, `ServerTransport`, and middleware.

## Usage

Add the package dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime", from: "0.1.0"),
```

and in your target, add `OpenAPIRuntime` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIRuntime", package: "swift-openapi-runtime"),
],
```

Next step depends on your use case:

1. Use the types from this library with your generated client and server code. To learn more, review the adoption guides in the [Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation][1], which explains how the packages fit together.
2. Implement a custom transport or middleware to extend your generated client and server. For client code, check out `ClientTransport` and `ClientMiddleware`. For server code, check out `ServerTransport` and `ServerMiddleware`. You can also publish your transport or middleware to allow others to use it with their generated code.
