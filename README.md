# Swift OpenAPI Generator Runtime

This library provides common abstractions and helper functions used by the client and server code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator][0].

## Overview

It contains:
- Common types used in the code generated by the `swift-openapi-generator` package plugin.
- Protocol definitions for pluggable layers, including `ClientTransport`, `ServerTransport`, and middleware.

## Usage

Add the package dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime", from: "0.1.0"),
```

and in your target, add `OpenAPIRuntime` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIRuntime", package: "swift-openapi-runtime"),
],
```

The next step depends on your use case.

### Using Swift OpenAPI Generator for code generation

The generated code depends on types from this library. Check out the adoption guides in the [Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation][1] to see how the packages fit together.

### Implementing transports and middlewares

Swift OpenAPI Generator generates client and server code that is designed to be used with pluggable transports and middlewares.

Implement a new transport or middleware by providing a type that adopts one of the protocols from the runtime library:

* `ClientTransport`
* `ClientMiddleware`
* `ServerTransport`
* `ServerMiddleware`

You can also publish your transport or middleware as a Swift package to allow others to use it with their generated code.
